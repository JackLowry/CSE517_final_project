It was a big seller until we had to recall the cherries.
<pad> A play on the term " cher ries "  ---  if  a cherry pie were made from scratch , it would usually be packaged with  ice cream , but here , the cherry pie is literally made of  ice cream , which is why the factory has put  a giant  nozzle on top of each cherry pie to make sure that it stays soft . While this may seem odd , the cherries are in fact cherries from  a  berry bush , which makes it funny because  ice cream is
