He says making lemonade is not an option.
<pad> An older woman is telling  a young man that making lemon a de is not an option . Death , who normally wouldn ' t give food , is trying to get the woman to agree  ---  he is  s col d ing the man for asking for lemon a de , as  if lemon a de is an option . It ' s funny because it ' s not clear why death would not give food , and even  if  he did ,  he might not offer lemon a de .
