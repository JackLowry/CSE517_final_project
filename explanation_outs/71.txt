Would you feel more comfortable on the floor?
<pad> The  therapist is  arguing about whether or not someone should be on the floor during  a session . Instead of the usual straight line discussion about whether or not the person should be on the floor , the more sub du e d approach is taken . It ' s  a playful , slightly humorous comparison of the ways people feel about  a session ( i . e . , on the side of the couch )  versus how someone might feel about  a session ( i . e . , on the
