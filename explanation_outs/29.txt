So sue me.
<pad> There ' s  a trop e that  a deceased person would su e the person who killed him ,  i . e . , that the deceased person had su ici d al intentions , and would su e the person who killed him . But here , the person is literally su ici d al because  he ' s in the bathroom trying to clean up after himself , and  he just broke through the door . It ' s funny partly because of the contrast between the serious ness of the situation ,
