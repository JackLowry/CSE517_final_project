I can't say for sure, but I think the airline mixed up my luggage.
<pad> Two men are sitting next to each other in  a car , apparently trying to figure out how the other is going to get his luggage out of the trunk . It ' s  a common  occurrence that an airline might not have  notified the passenger that their luggage was lost , or that they had it mixed up because the company was expecting it to arrive sooner . But here , instead of the usual concern about lost luggage , the more realistic concern is that the airline might have mis l aid the luggage
