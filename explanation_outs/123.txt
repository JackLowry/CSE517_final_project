I should have jumped from a higher floor.
<pad> A joke about  a man who fell to his death from  a building  --- " I should have  jumped from  a higher floor " is how people react when they see an off - color photo of their friend . It ' s funny because the person  presumably thought they would be safer  if they  jumped  --- and yet , they are on the same floor as the person in the photo . </s>
